## ABOUT ME

I am Yunting Wang(王允婷), a fourth-year undergraduate student at [Department of Astronomy, Xiamen University](https://astro.xmu.edu.cn/en/HOME.htm).

My primary interest is in galaxy formation and evolution, including gas cycling, co-evolution of central black holes and galaxies, high-redshift galaxies, gravitation lensing, numerical simulations, etc. Still, I am open to new ideas as well.

Currently, I am studying transitional galaxies indicated by [NII]/[SII] using IFU data from SDSS [MaNGA](https://www.sdss.org/dr14/manga/)(Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO) survey, advised by [Prof. Lei Hao](http://sourcedb.shao.cas.cn/yw/pl/fs/201012/t20101218_3046501.html) from Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, Chinese Academy of Science(SHAO) and [Prof. Taotao Fang](https://astro.xmu.edu.cn/info/1074/1848.htm) at Xiamen University. My ongoing undergraduate thesis is on mapping the star formation rate change in NGC4254 with VLT [MUSE](https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/develop/instruments/muse.html)(Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer) data, advised by [Prof. Amelie Saintonge](http://www.star.ucl.ac.uk/~amelie/) from University College London. You could find out more about my work on the [Research](https://yunting-wang.github.io/research) page.
