## ABOUT ME

I am Yunting Wang(王允婷), a fourth-year undergraduate student at [Department of Astronomy, Xiamen University](https://astro.xmu.edu.cn/en/HOME.htm).

My primary interest is in research that advances our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, including crucial topics such as star formation quenching mechanism, AGN feedback in galactic scales, and physical properties of high-redshift galaxies. I am also interested in other areas, such as gravitational lensing and exoplanets.

Currently, I am studying transitional galaxies indicated by [NII]/[SII] using IFU data from SDSS [MaNGA](https://www.sdss.org/dr14/manga/)(Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO) survey, advised by [Prof. Lei Hao](http://sourcedb.shao.cas.cn/yw/pl/fs/201012/t20101218_3046501.html) from Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, Chinese Academy of Science(SHAO). My ongoing undergraduate thesis is on mapping the star formation rate change in NGC4254 with VLT [MUSE](https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/develop/instruments/muse.html)(Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer) data, advised by [Prof. Amelie Saintonge](http://www.star.ucl.ac.uk/~amelie/) from University College London. You could find out more about my work on the [Research](https://yunting-wang.github.io/research) page.
