title: About me
---

I am Yunting Wang(王允婷), a third-year undergraduate student at [Department of Astronomy, Xiamen University](https://astro.xmu.edu.cn/en/HOME.htm).

I am interested in research shedding light on questions that help advance our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, including crucial topics such as star formation quenching mechanism, AGN feedback in low-mass galaxies, and physical properties of low surface brightness galaxies. I am also enthusiastic about all aspects of astrophysics and cosmology.

My current research is focused on diffuse ionized gas, advised by Professor Lei Hao in Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, Chinese Academy of Science(SHAO). I work mainly on exploring the mechanism of the rare prominent [NII]/[SII] ratio, using IFU data from SDSS MaNGA survey. You could find out more about it on the [Research](https://yunting-wang.github.io/Research_Summary.pdf) page.
