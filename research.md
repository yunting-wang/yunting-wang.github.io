## Exploring Transitional Galaxies Indicated by [NII]/[SII] ratios

Various kinds of galaxies have been proposed to be in the transitional stages of galaxy evolution. Previous works on FUV-luminous galaxies have found unusually high-[NII]/[SII]-ratio galaxies also show compact nature, strong outflows, and vigorous star formations (Overzier et al., 2009). Additionally, Xie et al. (2014, 2015, 2016) also found their unique spectral properties in MIR. 

We have undertaken an extensive study of the [NII]/[SII] properties in the SDSS MaNGA (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory). We adopt the criteria of log([NII]/[SII]) > 0.5 and log([OIII]/[Hβ]) < 0.2 (to rule out possible AGN contaminations) and limit ourselves with galaxies that have S/N > 10. We found five galaxies with at least five spaxels that show high-[NII]/[SII] ratios, three of which also show deep NaID doublet absorption feature, which probes neutral gas outflows.

We also proposed to probe the HI gas contents of 5 galaxies with high [NII]/[SII] ratios and 11 with moderate[NII]/[SII] ratios through [FAST](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020RAA....20...64J/abstract)(Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope; PI: [Prof. Taotao Fang](https://astro.xmu.edu.cn/info/1074/1848.htm)). We expect to detect the HI gas contents in these galaxies and correlate with their galactic properties and star formation activities combined with MaNGA data.

## Mapping the Star Formation Rate Change in Nearby Galaxies

M99(NGC4254) is a spiral galaxy in the Virgo cluster undergoing peculiar environmental changes with an extended HI structure. The goal is to build a star formation change map of the galaxy with data from VLT MUSE(Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer) and GALEX(Galaxy Evolution Explorer), and explore the SFR histories in different regions of NGC4254.

We obtain the mosaicked VLT MUSE (Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer) data cube for NGC4254, and fit Hα and Hβ emission lines. We combine it with ultraviolet data from GALEX and SDSS u band data, and produced the color-color plot to indicate the star formation history.

{% include image.html url="https://yunting-wang.github.io/images/sfh.png" description="Example color-color plot by pixels in NGC4254. The blue, orange, green dots and lines are expected colors derived at different ages (in Myr) of a recent burst or quenching for an E(B − V) = 0.0 (blue), 0.1 (orange), and 0.2 (green), respectively. The ratio of the variation (after/before) is 0.001 in this plot. The color of dots denotes the relative distance from the center of the galaxy." %}

In addition, we derived modeled spectra given the delayed star formation history model plus a recent burst or quenching, using the CIGALE (Code Investigating GALaxy Emission) SED (Stellar Energy Distribution) code, and compare the evolution tracks with the observation data.

We also extend our study on other nearby galaxies with different SFR and stellar mass properties, such as NGC5068, NGC2835 and NGC1365.
