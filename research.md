## Exploring Transitional Galaxies Indicated by [NII]/[SII] ratios

Previous works on FUV-luminous galaxies have found unusually high-[NII]/[SII]-ratio galaxies also show compact nature, strong outflows, and vigorous star formations (Overzier et al., 2009). Such galaxies also exhibit particular MIR spectral features, including the crystallized silicate features (Xie et al., 2014, 2015, 2016). These characteristics indicate that these galaxies may exist in a transitional stage where galaxy mergers have induced intensive nuclear starbursts, as suggested from numerical simulations (Hopkins et al., 2008).

We have undertaken an extensive study of the [NII]/[SII] properties in the SDSS MaNGA (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory). We adopt the criteria of log([NII]/[SII]) > 0.5 and log([OIII]/[Hβ]) < 0.2 (to rule out possible AGN contaminations) and limit ourselves with galaxies that have S/N > 10. We found five galaxies with at least five spaxels that show high-[NII]/[SII] ratios, three of which also show deep NaID doublet absorption feature, which probes neutral gas outflows.

We also proposed to probe the HI gas contents of 5 galaxies with high [NII]/[SII] ratios and 11 with moderate[NII]/[SII] ratios through [FAST](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020RAA....20...64J/abstract)(Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope). We expect to detect the HI gas contents in these galaxies and correlate with their galactic properties and star formation activities combined with MaNGA data.

## Mapping the Star Formation Rate Change in Nearby Galaxies

M99(NGC4254) is a spiral galaxy in the Virgo cluster undergoing peculiar environmental changes with an extended HI structure. The goal is to build a star formation change map of NGC4254 to catch the regions in the transformation of star formation activities, using spatially-resolved spectra from VLT MUSE together with photometry from GALEX, SDSS and Spitzer.

We obtained the mosaicked VLT MUSE (Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer) data cube for NGC4254, and fitted Hα and Hβ emission lines. We combined it with ultraviolet data from GALEX and SDSS u band data, and produced the color-color plot to compare with the evolutionary track derived from CIGALE (Code Investigating GALaxy Emission) SED (Stellar Energy Distribution) code given parametric Star Formation History (SFH) model.

{% include image.html url="https://yunting-wang.github.io/images/sfh.png" description="Example color-color plot by pixels in NGC4254. The blue, orange, green dots and lines are expected colors derived at different ages (in Myr) of a recent burst or quenching for an E(B − V) = 0.0 (blue), 0.1 (orange), and 0.2 (green), respectively. The ratio of the variation (after/before) is 0.001 in this plot. The color of dots denotes the relative distance from the center of the galaxy." %}

We found that the combination of NUV-u and FUV-NUV colors is relatively insensitive to dust. Currently, we are extending our study on other nearby galaxies with different SFR and stellar mass properties, such as NGC5068 and NGC1365, and improving the SFH modeling with non-parametric models using the Prospector packages.
